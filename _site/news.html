        <p><strong>Oct 26th 2023</strong> An Open Science Award. The <a href="https://github.com/OpenSourceMycetoma">MycetOS</a> drug discovery project, founded by Mat, was awarded the <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/news/winners-announced-eur-open-and-responsible-science-awards">Open Research prize by the Erasmus University of Rotterdam</a>. The project uses open-source research methods to find new potential treatments for the neglected tropical disease, mycetoma, without secrecy or patents. Contributors to the project include Mat’s PhD student Dmitrij Melechov, staff at Erasmus University and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative and many others, such as the UK school children who have made new candidate molecules and, most recently, a cohort of our very own MSc Drug Discovery students in the School of Pharmacy in 2023.</p>

<p><strong>June 7th 2022</strong> Mat contributed to a report on open data sharing practices during the COVID pandemic, that was <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/6620854#.YtknTZDMI-Q">published today</a> by Wellcome, UKRI and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</p>

<p><strong>May 20th 2022</strong> The group receives about £2M from the National Institutes of Health as part of a $63M award to an antiviral drug discovery centre, <a href="https://uncnews.unc.edu/2022/05/20/unc-chapel-hill-receives-65m-from-nih-for-antiviral-drug-development-center/">READDI-AViDD</a>, based at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Mat’s group will work on the medicinal chemistry of multiple projects and will share all findings publicly in real time, in line with the group’s open science principles. The aim is to work together to improve our pandemic preparedness. <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lifesciences-faculty/news/2022/jun/professor-matthew-todd-and-professor-robin-ketteler-awarded-grant">UCL news item</a></p>

<p><strong>Mar 28th 2022</strong> Mat is awarded £10,000 from the Rosetrees Trust following a successful application for funding led by the open science non-profit, Ersilia.io. The project will allow iterative design-synthesis-test cycles for the leading project in Open Source Malaria, where new potential antimalarials will be designed using Ersilia’s AI/ML methods and evaluated in blood stage potency assays.</p>

<p><strong>Mar 28th 2022</strong> Mat is awarded $250K from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Structural Genomics Consortium as part of an $5M consortium aimed at finding new non-hormonal female contraceptives. This major open science initiative, running for three years, will have project champions across UCL, Toronto, University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, Frankfurt, McGill and Karolinska. The UCL team’s job is to find potent, selective, cell-penetrant inhibitors of phospholipase C zeta 1, an under-explored target central to human fertilisation. <a href="https://github.com/StructuralGenomicsConsortium/CNP5-PLCZ1">Science details</a></p>

<p><strong>Mar 15th 2022</strong> The group’s research is mentioned in the Financial Times’ article <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61e1d51e-b415-4161-b157-032e5207ab7f">“Will ‘open-source’ vaccines narrow the inequality gap exposed by Covid?”</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Feb 14th 2022</strong> Mat wins £35,604 from the EPSRC Impact Acceleration Account/Knowledge Exchange and Innovation Funding scheme to run an AI/ML open science challenge to find new starting points for antibiotics. With Brooks Paige (Turing Institute) and Peter Coveney (Chemistry), a protein target is being provided, and AI/ML researchers who use “generative” methods for molecule generation can predict compounds that will bind that protein. Mat’s lab will make or buy the molecules, which will be evaluated at the University of Warwick, with all data being shared in real time. You can find details <a href="https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/murligase/issues/69">here</a></p>
