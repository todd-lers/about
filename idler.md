# Idler compounds

We’ve created the **Todd Idler Compound Library** to catalogue, share and make best use of compounds synthesised in the Todd Group. The setup and sharing process is summarised in the graphic below and described in the manuscript **“Idler Compounds: A Simple Protocol for Openly Sharing Fridge Contents for Cross-Screening”** (ChemRxiv DOI pending).

As proof-of-concept, compounds have been shared with **UKHSA**, generating new data that now feeds into ongoing programmes and offers new starting points for projects. Results and underlying data are openly provided via the resources below.
