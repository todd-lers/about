# Idler compounds
We’ve created the **Todd Idler Compound Library** to catalogue, share and make best use of compounds synthesised in the Todd Group. The setup and sharing process is summarised in the graphic below and described in the manuscript **“Idler Compounds: A Simple Protocol for Openly Sharing Fridge Contents for Cross-Screening”** (DOI: [10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-nqjb4](https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/689f3121a94eede154e5ce6a)).



As proof-of-concept, compounds have been shared with **UKHSA**, generating new data that now feeds into ongoing programmes and offers new starting points for projects. Results and underlying data are openly provided via the resources below.

## Get started (Resources)

- **Live inventory (Google Sheet):**  [Link to spreadsheet](https://uk-mynotebook.labarchives.com/doc/view/MTkyNS4zfDIxNzcxLzE0ODEvRW50cnlQYXJ0LzE0Mzg2NjQ4NDN8NDg4Ny4z?nb_id=MjgzMDIuM3wyMTc3MS8yMTc3MS9Ob3RlYm9vay8zODQ5MTQwNjQ0fDcxODQ0LjM%3D)

- **LabArchives notebook (data):**  [View notebook](https://uk-mynotebook.labarchives.com/share/Todd%2520Group%2520Compound%2520Library/MC4wfDIxNzcxLzAvVHJlZU5vZGUvMTcyMDU1ODA0NHwwLjA=)  

- **Zenodo collection:**   [https://zenodo.org/records/16793669](https://zenodo.org/records/16793669)






## How it works
1. **Accumulate compounds** (purchased & synthesised).
2. **Build a shareable library** (stock samples + online records).
3. **Curate a diverse plate** and share (e.g., with **UKHSA**).
4. **Receive results** → generate new data & starting points → feed back to projects.
