# Idler compounds
We’ve created the **Todd Idler Compound Library** to catalogue, share and make best use of compounds synthesised in the Todd Group. The setup and sharing process is summarised in the graphic below and described in the manuscript **“Idler Compounds: A Simple Protocol for Openly Sharing Fridge Contents for Cross-Screening”** (ChemRxiv DOI pending).

As proof-of-concept, compounds have been shared with **UKHSA**, generating new data that now feeds into ongoing programmes and offers new starting points for projects. Results and underlying data are openly provided via the resources below.

## Get started (Resources)
- **Live inventory (Google Sheet):** <https://YOUR-SHEET-LINK>
- **LabArchives notebook (overview):** <https://YOUR-LABARCHIVES-LINK>
- **LabArchives notebook (data):** <https://YOUR-LABARCHIVES-DATA-LINK>
- **Zenodo collection:** <https://YOUR-ZENODO-LINK>
- **Preprint:** ChemRxiv DOI to be added here once available.

## How it works
1. **Accumulate compounds** (purchased & synthesised).
2. **Build a shareable library** (stock samples + online records).
3. **Curate a diverse plate** and share (e.g., with **UKHSA**).
4. **Receive results** → generate new data & starting points → feed back to projects.
