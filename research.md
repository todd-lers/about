We are most known for the [Open Source Malaria](http://opensourcemalaria.org/#) project, our [open science](http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html) work more generally and for the use of [click-derived triazoles in chemical sensing](http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/C0CS00143K). However, there are plenty of other projects that interest us.

# Open Science

We live in the age of the internet, one of the most transformative inventions of our time. Computer scientists understood what the internet meant - working together without barriers. Scientists are just catching up. We could collaborate in more productive ways if only we were less wedded to secrecy.

We have adopted open source principles to experimental lab science. The first project successfully used this idea to find a way of producing the important drug praziquantel (used to treat the dreadful disease [Schistosomiasis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schistosomiasis)) as a single enantiomer. All data and ideas were freely shared and anybody could take part. People did - about 30, and the problem was more quickly solved than we could have alone because strangers came along and contributed where they were able to. The science was published [here](http://www.plosntds.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pntd.0001260) (check out the awesome links to actual lab notebook pages) and the way we did it was published separately in [Nature Chemistry](http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/v3/n10/full/nchem.1149.html). The website where it all got started was [The Synaptic Leap](http://www.thesynapticleap.org/node/286) and all the work was described in [an online electronic lab notebook (ELN)](http://www.ourexperiment.org/racemic_pzq).

This made us think, what about drug discovery? Could we discover new drugs using an open approach and without patents? So, we started a project to see if this works and we're now driving the Open Source Malaria project, a fully open, borderless, patentless drug discovery project for malaria that aims to discover a compound that will enter Phase I clinical trials. It's a fantastically exciting project made possible by the continual contributions of a scientists around the world.

### Open Source Malaria <a href="https://twitter.com/o_s_m"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>

Mat founded the **Open Source Malaria (OSM) Consortium** ([Github](https://github.com/OpenSourceMalaria), [Landing Page](http://opensourcemalaria.org/#))

(A brief note on the Pied Piper role. Open source projects benefit from a coordinator, to guide, assimilate, reach out. This is often referred to as a [Pied Piper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin) role, but a _much_ better analogy is the [James Murray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Murray_(lexicographer)) role.)

### Open Source Tuberculosis <a href="https://twitter.com/opensourcetb"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>

Mat founded the [Open Source Tuberculosis (OSTB) Consortium ](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_General_Start_Here) and there are currently three compound series.

<center><img src="./pics/research/OSTB Summary.png" width="90%"></center>

**[OSTB Series 1](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_1/wiki/What-is-OSTB-Series-1%3F)** - _The spiro series_

Many of the compounds in this series displayed high potency vs _M.tb_ but a significant risk of hERG inhibition and a lower-than-desired _in vivo_ tolerability combined lead us to park the series. The series was publish in [J. Med. Chem.](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.8b01533) in 2018 and all the [data](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_1/wiki/Sources-of-Data) is available for anyone to pursue.

**[OSTB Series 2](https://openwetware.org/wiki/OpenSourceTB:OSTB_Series_2)** - _Imidazopyridines_

**OSTBS27** was identified by GSK in a high throughput screen. **OSTBS27** is active against both replicating _M.tb_ (MIC vs. H37Rv = 10 μM) and non-replicating TB (>50% inhibition in 10 experiments out of 13) with mean PXC50 of 5.2 μM. The project is currently available for anyone to pursue.

**[OSTB Series 3](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_3/wiki)** - _Small molecule inhibitors of non-replicating M.tb_

**OSTBS83** was identified by GSK and Cornell University in [2015](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsinfecdis.5b00025)
as a selective inhibitor of non-replicating _M.tb_ (NR IC90 = 2.01 μM). This project is [active](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/OSTB_Series_3) and to date [> 60 compounds](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z2cjYPx4elBNuZOQjKd0Gn4aTQMz_W58dztc1uYSpZg/edit#gid=0) have been evaluated for activity against non-replicating M.tb, in a pursuit to develop a new drug for [latent tuberculosis](https://www.who.int/tb/areas-of-work/preventive-care/ltbi_faqs/en/).

_Contributions to this project are welcomed._

### Open Source Antibiotics <a href="https://twitter.com/OSantibiotics"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>

We have founded the [Open Source Antibiotics](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/GeneralTopics) (OSA) consortium which consists of researchers interested in open ways to discover and develop new, inexpensive medicines for bacterial infections. There are currently two series in the OSA consortium.

**[OSA Series 1](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/murligase)** - _Mur ligases_

The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, specifically inhibitors of the Mur ligase enzymes using a fragment based approach.

**[OSA Series 2](https://github.com/opensourceantibiotics/Series-2-Diarylimidazoles)** - _Diarylimidazoles_

The focus is the discovery and development of new antibiotics, specifically the optimisation of a series of molecules discovered at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

This series has been the focus of a number of 2020 [research meetings](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0eLxnHhou_k1Upbn5X1mdHBwKMYkRpLH).

### Open Source Mycetoma <a href="https://twitter.com/MycetOS"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>


### Open Source Pharma <a href="https://twitter.com/opensrcpharma"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a>

We've co-founded a broader open source pharma movement which has been defined by participants from across the public and private sectors, with early backing from Open Society Foundations, The Rockefeller Foundation and Tata Trusts. The idea is to promote more open forms of collaboration towards "Medicines for All". The underlying ideas were discussed at WHO in 2013 ([WHO News Item](https://www.who.int/tdr/news/2013/odd/en/)), and guiding principles were established at a [meeting](https://www.opensourcepharma.net/bellagio.html) in 2014 ([WHO News Item](https://www.who.int/tdr/news/2014/open-source-pharma-mtg/en/)) with further [conferences](https://www.opensourcepharma.net/conferences.html) in 2015 and 2019. The overall approach is described in a short [2017 "Roadmap" paper](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002276) (with more details provided in the longer [supporting information](https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002276#sec006) document).

### Licences

There is no adequate licence to cover entire open source drug discovery projects. Open Source Malaria and others use the CC-BY licence. [Data should abide by the FAIR principles](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01720-7). [Linking those who generate data with the downstream use of that data](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-01715-4) (for credit) might be desirable.

# Synthetic Methodology

The group's motto is _To make the right molecule in the right place at the right time_. While nobody understands what this means it is crucial that we know how to make molecules. The group is mainly interested in developing methods for the construction of new bonds in small molecules, i.e. the development of ways of making bonds that cannot currently be made.

New project in Late Stage Functionalisation. Relevant to this: [Late stage azidation](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acscentsci.6b00214), [catalyst-controlled site-selective bond activation](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.accounts.6b00546).

<a name="asymmetric_catalysis"></a>
# Asymmetric Catalysis

One of the most value but difficult things an organic chemist can do is to selectively synthesise one enantiomer of a molecule, and most impressively via catalysis. We are interested in asymmetric catalysis and the rational development of new catalysts for asymmetric reactions. Recently we ran an [Open Source Catalysis Project](http://115.146.85.21/) and this is awaiting the right student to reboot it.

# Chemical Education

We made up a very cool Treasure Hunt for chemical education that you can read about here. Essentially the answers to questions guide you round a campus so that you find certain objects, and when you have found all the objects you draw them out on a campus map and the shape gives you the structure of a molecule, which is the "treasure". This could work for lots of other disciplines too and it'd be possible to use Google Maps to make a global version, though we've not yet tried.

We also like chemical animations. We like getting students involved with making real molecules in large numbers - we have done this through the Open Source Malaria project with some success.

In response to the price hike of HIV/AIDS drug, pyrimethamine (Daraprim), by Turing Pharmaceuticals, we helped a small team of high school students from Sydney Grammar School to synthesise the drug. The team produced 3.7 grams of Daraprim for $US20, which would be worth between $US35,000 and $US110,000 in the United States based on hiked prices. This received significant media attention and was featured on ABC, BBC, CNN, The Guardian, and Time.
